## What is this?
This is the unofficial system for Anima Beyond Fantasy for Foundry VTT, developed with the knowledge and agreement of [Anima Project Studio](https://twitter.com/animaps).

The system provides character sheet, and some game mechanic support such as managed combat support or other minimum character sheet automation. 
It also provides dice mechanics, and some compendia like:

### Spanish compendia

- Weapons
- Armors
- Magic

### English compendia

To be defined! Because it was developed by a spanish community, we are only supporting the Spanish compendia so far,
but we'd love to get community support for this task. 
So if you'd want to translate or create your compendium and add it to the system, you can do it here.

## Community Contribution

As we said before, we love community support, so if you have some system improvement, bug, idea, or code improvement, we are all ears. Here you can add all of it.
